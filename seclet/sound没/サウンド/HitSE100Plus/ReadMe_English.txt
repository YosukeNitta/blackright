[+]About file name
   files are named in order of my creation.
   Files with suffix like "DMGXX_B" means it is modified sound based 
   on "DMGXX".
   
   
[+]About file format
   Wave file(maybe linear PCM).
   Sampling rate is not unified but many of sound are 44,100Hz, so
   it may better to down the rate(this make your products file size
   smaller).
   
   
[+]What's "OnlyPlayWav.exe"?
   It is my software that plays wav file. Not a modifier.
   This software is superior to do with explorer(quick). 
   
   
[+]Tales each sound
   DMG04
     After listen all of the sounds, you may notice this file is a 
     modification of DMG41, that is not included this pack at that 
     point. 
   
   DMG08
     This type of sound is relatively easy to make.
     It is made by excessively maximizing partial sound's volume.
     
   DMG14_B
     Can't find out usage? umm...
     How about for crash one's bone? 
     
   DMG23
     This is old sound, and it was my finest work at that time,
     though sound quality is low.
     
   DMG28
     Based from door-closing sound.
     
   DMG65
     Yes, it is a sound of closing refrigerator. not modified.
     
   DMG84
     It likes slash sounds used in Japanese Samurai TV.
     But nowadays these are also used in comedies.
